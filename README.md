# 💸 FundFlow

**FundFlow** is a C++-powered donation tracking system built for clarity, control, and accountability. It helps organize donors, record multi-type donations, allocate them to causes, rank top contributors, and generate clean receipts — all through a structured command-line interface.

## 🔍 Overview

FundFlow simplifies the process of tracking aid and donations. Designed with real-world needs in mind, it ensures that every contribution — whether it's money, goods, or time — is properly recorded, categorized, and reported.

## ❗ Real-Life Problem

Charity drives, fundraisers, and relief campaigns often struggle with:
- Scattered donor records  
- Manual donation tracking  
- Lost or missing receipts  
- No clear view of top contributors or cause impact  

This results in inefficiency, poor accountability, and misallocation of funds.

## ✅ Solution

**FundFlow** automates and organizes the entire donation pipeline:
- Records donors and donations with proper categorization
- Tracks monetary and non-monetary contributions
- Summarizes donation totals per cause
- Ranks top donors for transparency and motivation
- Generates official receipts using file handling  
- All while keeping data persistent, clean, and centralized
